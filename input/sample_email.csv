this is a story about astronomy
Comet Kohoutek was the poster child for a comet that faded and did not live up to expectations 
I saw it when it was close to the sun in 1974 from the balcony of the LBJ apartment building
Because Kohoutek fell short of expectations its name became synonymous with disappointment
we have learned why Kohoutek faded and other comets brightened when close to the sun. 
Kohoutek was an Oort Cloud comet on its first visit to the inner solar system
most of the ices on its surface evaporated early while it was still relatively far out in space  
When it brightened dramatically while still beyond the orbit of Mars
astronomers at the time thought the light curve would continue to rise
but in fact the outburst near Mars was the brightest it ever got in absolute magnitude
It was a very scientifically interesting comet when it rounded the sun
At one point its tail stretched 25 degrees across the sky but by then  the nucleus had faded
Very respectable  compared to most typical comets
Never the less its name became synonymous with a BIG DUD mostly because of the HYPE ahead of time 
It was only visible in binoculars or telescopes from light polluted urban skies
between 1974 and 2020 there were other bright naked eye comets like Hale-Bopp and Hyakutake
I remember seeing Comet West in 1976 from the Andover campus
comet West in 1976 was the REAL comet of the century
most people never heard about Comet West until after it was gone
very few people bothered to get up early to see the comet before dawn in February and March that year
This is because the media didn't bother to report it after they got burned by the Comet Kohoutek fiasco   
It was a cold a snowy winter that year so I only managed to glimpse it from the window of my dorm room
For a few days after perihelion the comet was almost as bright as Venus
in the daytime if you knew exactly where to look
there must not be any commas in this file
during March of that year the comet came within several million miles of the sun
Venus is currently at near the sun close to the greatest elongation for the year
In the chart immediately below the red line shows the path of the comet in Sagittarius
the position of Venus shown is where it is NOW near the star Nunki in the constellation Sagittarius
which is one of the 4 stars that make up the "handle of the Teapot" or also visualized as the arm of an archer 
Venus will still be in Sagittarius but not exactly where it is shown on the map
comet west was an amazing sight when I saw it during high school
